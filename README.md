Star-Trek-Armada-3
==================

a "unofficial" free sequel to Star Trek Armada 2

Suggested Ideas:

- Use a multi-platform foundation ( http://jmonkeyengine.com/ ). 
- OpenGL is a MUST. Do not want to limit oneself to microsoft's DirectX.
- The Star Trek Armada gameplay mechanics must be "rethinked", because their old and feel problematic at times. They are also copying Starcraft too much.
